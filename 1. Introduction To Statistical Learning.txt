SL: Statistical Learning


- SL refers to vast set of tools for understanding data
	- supervised - predicting or estimating
	- unsupervised 

- Regression problem - predict continuous or quantitative output value
	- certain cases, predict non-numeric - categorical or qualitative output

- Classification - output fall into N buckets

Figure 2.1 - smarket data box plots -  the % change for previous day with today's direction.
	securities with -ve % change yesterday could go up.


- clustering problem - group objects/individuals according to their characteristics.

- principal components of data - reduced dimensions

- history
	- 19the century - least squares, linear regression for quantitative values
	- 1936 - linear discriminant analysis for predicting qualitative values
	- 1940 - logistic regression - alternative approach for predicting qualitative values
	- 1970s - generalized linear model - class of SL methods, include both linear and logistic regression
	- 1980s - classification and regression trees, followed by generalized additive models
	- 1980s - Neural Networks
	- 1990s - Support vector machines

SL - subfield in statistics, focused on supervised and unsupervised modeling and prediction


Notations
	- n = number of data points/observations
	- p = number of variables
	- xij = value of jth variable for ith observation
		where i=1,2,3,...,n and j=1,2,3,...,p
	- X = n x p matrix
	- xi = ith row -> vector of p x 1 shape = ith observation
	- xj = jth column -> vector of n x 1 shape = jth variable
